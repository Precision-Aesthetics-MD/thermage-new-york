But, with so many different providers, huge range of prices, and resisting buyer reviews, walking the path to the right Thermage provider can be daunting at best.Questions To Ask Potential Thermage Providers1. Will I be examined by the physician prior to my procedure? Many regions that give" free consultations" generally is necessary that private individuals sits in a consultation room with an aesthetician, technician, or nurse. You may or may not receive a physical examination. Thermage is a medical procedure and Thermage machines can only be purchased by physicians. Every potential Thermage patient should have a medical history taken and also receive a focused physical examination by a doctor prior to the procedure. Medical doctors should rule out any possible medical contraindications to having the procedure, as well as any underlying medical conditions or drugs that would prevent you from getting results out the necessary procedures. 2. Is the doctor on premises during my procedure? Some Medispas are "overseen" by physicians who have no knowledge of cosmetic procedures or have any training in that area. Many are emergency room physicians or other specialties that have just changed careers for fiscal reasons. 3. Does the doctor perform my procedure? If not, who does? Can I realize their certificate of training? The doctor doesn't necessarily have to perform the Thermage procedure . The best answers occur with the most experienced providers which are identified by either a black diamond or spire status on the Thermage.com website. These are awarded for the greatest number of procedures delivered. However as of 2012 Fraxel quantities are being counted towards Black Diamond and Pinnacle status, kind of shaping those identifications now meaningless, since Fraxel although owned by Solta the same company, is a completely different procedure, So look for those bestows going back a number of years indicating many years of suffer not just one. Some of the most famous physicians on television do not perform any cares at all. Another part of insider knowledge is to determine a doctor coach or their direct "disciple". Physician trainers teach other doctors but that teaching are likely to be simply one day, whereas technicians in their apply have probably qualified with them and their techniques for years and are the ones that are delivering Thermage therapies every single day and are indeed the most experienced providers. Certified Technicians are trained in the various Thermage procedures by both their oversee medical doctors and Thermage. Certified Technicians are trained in safe practises to prevent the fact that there are skin scorches and undesired fat melting and at the completion of their training they are awarded a certificate. Ask to see their credential. Do not let any uncertified individual to perform your Thermage.4. What kind of drug will I have to take before my Thermage Procedure? Numbing cream is not to be used for Thermage. It changes the skin opposition. Many facilities give either a pain-pill or injection prior to the procedure, plus or minus a little valium. Thermage is not pain, but it can be a bit vexing since you have to sit still for about an hour per care region. Face and eyes are pretty comfy and can be done with no suffering drugs. Neck and figure can be more intense and agony drugs are generally recommended prior to working on these areas. Under NO contexts is it necessary or justified to have I.V. sedation or general anesthesia for your Thermage procedure. Not simply do you risk the complications of the anesthesia itself, but this is when severe smolders can occur leading to scarring and the possible is necessary to scalp grafts.5. Which machine do you have? Can I see it? Thermage has been around since 2002 and has undergone several important upgrades and improvements in their technologies, especially over the last 3 years. The original device in 2002 resembles a square carton about the dimensions of the a microwave and sits on a tabletop. This original version is now out-dated and incompatible with the newest Thermage tips because it lacks the output ability and acceleration to effectively treat with the newest tips-off. Thermage performed with this tabletop version of the machine will be painful, slacken, and yield sub-standard outcomes. In 2007, Thermage upgraded information and communication technologies to the NXT device( literally "next" without the "e") The NXT device stands upright and is about 4' tall on wheels( it is more like the dimensions of the a small human ). The NXT upgrade makes the necessary procedures faster and more comfortable for both individual patients and the provider. At the moment of its NXT release, brand-new Thermage tips likewise came out that were able to deliver faster, most efficient therapies and better results. Many physicians have upgraded to the NXT device. It is capable of delivering the vigour of some of the brand-new gratuities, but it is not the most advanced version of Thermage. In the Fall of 2009 Thermage launched the "CPT" comfort pulse technology upgrade. The machine gazes the same as that used the NXT device( approximately 4' upright on wheels ), but the human rights unit were re-programmed with a software upgrade that allows the machine to accept a new hand part that vibrates for patient consolation and the vibrating CPT hand piece likewise houses the newest CPT tip, which has an improved heating algorithm to heat 3 times as much tissue more precisely, attaining even better makes than the NXT.I will talk about hand fragments and gratuities in a moment, but to recap: OLD THERMAGE MACHINE( 2002)- Table top Unit. Cannot corroborate new tips, pain, and slow.NXT DEVICE( 2007)- 1ST upgrade. Faster, more comfy, corroborates second generation STC gratuities, DC, and CL body gratuities, and 16.0 figure tips with the special 16.0 hand fragment. CPT DEVICE( 2009) Newest technology . Supports vibrating CPT hand piece with newest CPT facial tips. Also newest 16.0 form tips with the special 16.0 hand piece.6. Which tip will you be using for my treatment? How many pulsates will I need for my therapy? Thermage units consist of a power source( upright for NXT and CPT ), a hand article( eyelid, look, CPT face, 16.0 body) and the Thermage tip itself. If the hand piece is the grease-gun, the Thermage tip is the bullet that is loaded into the gun. The tip has on one side a flat membrane( 3x3 for appearance, larger for body, smaller for eyes) that touches the skin surface. Inside the tip-off is a computer chip with a pre-determined number of "pulses" loaded onto it. Each pulsate consists of a cycles/second "cool-heat-cool" to cool the skin prior to the hot volley, then followed by another cooling explosion to lock in the heat energy and shield the scalp. Not simply do you need to be sure that you get the most recent upgraded gratuity, but also that you are getting a sufficient number of energy heartbeats for your desired result. Since Thermage is an expensive procedure for most "doctors " to provide, the more tips( pulses) you need, the most expensive the necessary procedures becomes.IMPORTANT- Each Thermage tip is shipped in a sealed parcel and is envisaged for single patient apply only. Once the number of energy pulsates "thats been" pre-programmed on the gratuity are gave, the gratuity stops working. This is for safety reasons as there can be membrane outage from excess delivery of hot pulses.Some unscrupulous characters will buy "re-furbished" Thermage tips that are used tips-off that have been "unlocked" so that the tip-off can be used again. Thermage issued a statement warning of the safety hazards inherent in these tips-off and asked providers not to buy them. Ask to see the unopened parcel that your gratuity came in prior to your procedure.<br><br><iframe
